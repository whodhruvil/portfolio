#### Some history

- I was introduced to computer when I was 9. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Road Rash, GTA Vice City, and Midtown Madness. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- At 10, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.
- At 14, I built my first webpage with HTML.
- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires 3.
- At 17, I took my first programm writen in c .

- At 20, I remember 8 February 2019 the day of my 1st job interview at [Codrain Technolab.](https://www.codraintechnolabs.com/)

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
