#### Intro

I am Dhruvil, working at [Saleshandy](https://saleshandy.com) as a Frontend Developer. My primary focus at Saleshandy is building user-centric features while maintaining a high-quality codebase.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in:

- Social impact
- Education
- Inclusivity
- Space

I enjoy advising companies and may be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and project scope. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Ahmedabad, India.

#### Currently

At Codrain, I have learned various development skills including React, React Native, Node.js, Express, and Magento. Codrain taught me how to work with a team on the same project.
<br><br>
At Aoroxa, I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build online predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications & mobile applications (see [aoroxa.com](https://aoroxa.com/)).

#### Some history

- I was introduced to computers when I was 9. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Road Rash, GTA Vice City, and Midtown Madness. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- At 10, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.
- At 14, I built my first webpage with HTML.
- From 14 to 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter-Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires 3.
- At 17, I wrote my first program in C.

- At 20, I remember February 8, 2019 - the day of my first job interview at [Codrain Technolab.](https://www.codraintechnolabs.com/)

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
